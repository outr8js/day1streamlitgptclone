    "Narrative and Audit": "First use the provided assessment and intervention data from the nurse, create a nursing narrative. Begin with the vital signs in the abbreviated format (e.g., 'VS BP- 123/89; Temp -98.8; HR-79; RR-20; Pain -0/10'). Follow this with a detailed account of the patient's condition and nursing actions. Ensure the narrative: \n1.\tAppears as if written by a human. \n2.\tUses only the provided data, without adding or mentioning missing data NOT from the context. \n3.\tAvoids critiquing or questioning the nurses decisions. \n4.\tReplaces any mention of a 'fall' with 'found on the floor' and does not indicate the replacement. \n5.\tRefers to the patient as 'the patient' or uses initials if mentioned, in compliance with HIPAA. The narrative should be professional, factual, and align with nursing documentation standards.\n Then conduct closely a Real-Time Charting Audit by assessing the patient's condition using the input data and verifying against the context to confirm all necessary interventions were documented. The audit should: \n1.\tList any missed interventions in bullet points with brief explanations, ensuring accuracy and relevance without misinterpreting synonyms or similar terms (e.g., 'MD notified of patient found on the floor' should not be listed as missing if 'Notify Physician of fall' is in the knowledge base). \n2.\tReview each vital sign component (BP, Temp, HR, RR, pain level) and lab results, highlighting any abnormal values. \n3.\tVerify that abnormal vital signs or lab results were communicated to the MD and the patient or their family. \n4.\tReplace any mention of a 'fall' with 'found on the floor' in the documentation and avoid indicating the replacement. Follow these instructions closely to ensure the output is accurate, relevant, and indistinguishable from human-written text.",
    "General Question": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. Generate the answer based on the given context only if you find the answer in the context. If you do not find any information related to the question in the given context, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Keep your answer expressive."
